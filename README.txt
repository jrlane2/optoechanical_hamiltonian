This is a repo that contains the simulation code for the MIM non-Hermitian dynamics/topology experiment.

Contains code for modeling the experiment using standard optomechanics, and calculating propagators for time dependent Hamiltonians.

This code is entierly designed around two-mode optomechanics.
